Hello world 👋 This is Juin Yau Lim (林俊耀). 

Never the smartest mind in class but always the one not afraid of trying new things. 

Fun-fact:
1. Enjoy playing with numbers _aka data analytics_. Juggling around AI, modeling, optimization, and blockchain. 
2. Polyglot, proficient in multiple languages. Try me!
3. 100% cat friendly

Thanks for spending time to understand me!
