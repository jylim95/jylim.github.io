*beep-boop* 

Hello world 👋 This is **Juin Yau Lim (林俊耀)**. 

I am interested on providing sustainable solution to complex engineering problem with my substantial background in Chemical Engineering **(*M.Eng*)** and Environmental Engineering **(*PhD*)**. Devoted to bridge the gap between research and industry.

You can find my [publications](./publication/), [recent post](./post/), and [one page résumé](/uploads/resume_s.pdf) in this webpage.

If you have more time, feel free to read my [full CV](/uploads/resume.pdf)! 

**Fun-fact:**
1. Enjoy playing with numbers _aka_ **Data Analytics**.             📈
2. Juggling around **AI**, **modeling**, and **optimization**.      🖥️
3. **Polyglot**, proficient in multiple languages. Try me!          🗣️
4. 100% **Cat** friendly                                            🐱

Never the smartest mind in class but always the one not afraid of trying new things. 

Thanks for spending time to understand me! *Ciao*
